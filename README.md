# e-servicebook

![Banner](img/baner.jpg)

**e-servicebook** is an Android app (Java) I developed as part of a commercial startup project.  
The goal was to create a digital service book system for **car owners** and **mechanics**, where repair history and other vehicle-related data could be stored, viewed, and securely transferred between owners.

Although the startup is no longer active and the backend service is unavailable, this repository showcases my ability to build Android applications in Java that connect to remote APIs, handle secure data storage, and provide a clean user interface.
